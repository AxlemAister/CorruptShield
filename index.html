    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>CorruptShield is an AI-powered initiative to promote transparency, fight corruption, and improve governance in the Philippines. By combining open data, blockchain technology, and community participation, we aim to protect public funds and ensure infrastructure projects truly benefit the people.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) has been implicated in massive corruption scandals involving infrastructure, particularly flood control. Key issues include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>₱545 billion</strong> allocated since 2022 — thousands of reported projects were substandard, undocumented, or did not exist.3</li>
      <li>Estimated losses due to anomalous flood projects (2023–2025) reached up to <strong>₱118.5 billion</strong>.4</li>
      <li>From 2011 to 2025, of the <strong>₱2 trillion</strong> spent on flood control, roughly <strong>₱1 trillion</strong> may have been lost to corruption.5</li>
      <li>Widespread issues: ghost flood projects, overpriced rock netting and cat’s eye reflectors, substandard materials and labor, collusion in bidding, unregulated bicameral budget insertions, Engineering Administrative Overhead (EAO) misuse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These systemic failures result in waste, trust erosion, and unsafe infrastructure instead of resilient national development.</p>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>CorruptShield introduces a multi-layered digital shield against corruption, designed to safeguard public resources and ensure project integrity. Core features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Bid Vetting</strong> – Machine learning highlights irregularities in contract submissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain Budget Tracking</strong> – Immutable records of funds, contracts, and milestones.</li>
      <li><strong>LIDAR & Geospatial Monitoring</strong> – Verifies actual construction for infrastructure projects.</li>
      <li><strong>International Best Practices</strong> – Models from the Netherlands, Singapore, Japan for flood and resilience planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Agentic AI Oversight</strong> – Autonomous monitoring that flags anomalies in real time.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Public Chatbot</strong> – Empowers citizens to report and track projects easily.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparent Dashboard</strong> – Inclusive platform for DPWH, COA, LGUs, mayors (M4GG), and public access.</li>
      <li><strong>M4GG (Mayors for Good Governance)</strong> – Local leaders driving accountability in their jurisdictions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, these tools help ensure that infrastructure investments deliver real, lasting impact.</p>
