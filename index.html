      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>CorruptShield is an AI-powered initiative to promote transparency, fight corruption, and improve governance in the Philippines. By combining open data, blockchain technology, and community participation, we aim to protect public funds and ensure infrastructure projects truly benefit the people.</p>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Every year, billions of pesos are lost to corruption in public infrastructure projects. According to reports, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) is consistently flagged for anomalies such as ghost projects, substandard materials, and overpricing. This not only wastes taxpayer money but also puts communities at risk through poor-quality roads, bridges, and flood control systems.</p>

      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <p>CorruptShield leverages <strong>AI</strong> for real-time anomaly detection in infrastructure data and <strong>blockchain</strong> for transparent, tamper-proof project records. By integrating public dashboards, COA oversight, and community reporting, we create a system where corruption is harder to hide and accountability becomes the standard.</p>
